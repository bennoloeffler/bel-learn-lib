; ERROR HANDLING,
;
; https://blog.jakubholy.net/2019/core-async-error-handling/
;
; See Book Clojure Reactive Programming, chapter Error Handling
; When an error occurs and needs to be propagated through a channel:
; 1. just return the exception itself.
; 2. read it by <? instead of <!
; This way, it will be thrown - and not forgotten...
; TODO: maybe there shound be a >? macro, that put's everything in a try catch like this
; SEE x_168_rx_selfmade
